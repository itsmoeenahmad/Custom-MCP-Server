**Before You Use the Code**

Take a moment to read through the code instead of just copy-pasting it. I’ve added comments to explain each part so you can understand what’s happening step by step.

If anything’s unclear or you’re stuck, feel free to reach out - you can DM me on Instagram or LinkedIn. I’m happy to help!
